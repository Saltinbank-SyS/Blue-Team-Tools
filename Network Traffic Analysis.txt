Traffic analysis can cover both PCAP data and Flow data. Here I am focusing on analyzing PCAP Data, as my use of Flow data is concerned mostly with hunting and monitoring.

*What I use*
All of the Traffic Analysis that I perform is done on a Ubuntu VM running the below tools. Most often when Analyzing a PCAP I use Wireshark and Network Miner side by side.

- Wireshark:
	- Graphical PCAP Analysis Tool
- TCPDump:
	- Command line based PCAP Analysis Tool
- Network Miner:
	- PCAP Parser and Analyzer
- Snort:
	- Intrusion Detection System
- Bro:
	- Intrusion Detection System
- Whois Lookup
	- IP Address Lookup Tool
