## Malware Analysis
Malware Analysis is a broad scope. My aim is to extract IOC's to use for further threat hunting and detection through both static and dynamic analysis.



### What I use


I use a suite of VM's for my Analysis that references the environments that I work with. The main testing ground is done on a Windows 7 VM with no AV installed. Then another Windows 7 VM with all the corporate security tools installed. Aditionally I will also use the Ubuntu VM mentioned in the below section for Network Traffic Analysis.
